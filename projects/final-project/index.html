            <p>
                Have you ever been cut off on the freeway and thought to yourself, "What a Maryland Driver..."? Well, if
                you have them you're not alone, because practically everyone I know from family members and friends to
                complete strangers believe that Maryland drivers are terrible. What I want to know is can we find
                statistical evidence to show that Maryland drivers really <b> ARE </b> that bad? Let's find out.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://zerodeathsmd.gov/resources/crashdata/"> Using data from 2019 to 2023</a>, Maryland
                drivers get into around 107,886 car crashes a year. Out of these roughly 108,000 accidents, 535 were
                fatalities while 28,609 of them led to injuries. Here is a visual breakdown of the 5 year data averages:
                <img src="img/MD 5 Year Average Accident Data.png" alt="5 Year MD Accident Data"
                    class="container-fluid">
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, where does Maryland stack up compared to the rest of the country? Well, according to a <a
                    href="https://www.lendingtree.com/insurance/best-worst-drivers-study/"> LendingTree
                    survey from 2024</a>, Maryland is rated <b>8th worst</b> in the nation for accidents per 1000
                drivers. We have
                24.3 accidents per 1,000 drivers which is not as high as Massachusetts with 44.4 accidents but is far
                off
                the median of 14.8 accidents.
            </p>

            <p>
                So according to their stats Maryland is home to the 8th worst drivers in
                America. Here's a visual of Maryland's accident rate comapred to the two highest and lowest states for
                reference:
                <img src="img/Accidents Per 1,000 Drivers .png" alt="Accidents Per 1000 Drivers"
                    class="container-fluid">
            </p>

            <p>
                Now let's compare to our neighbors on the East coast - Virginia and Delaware. Virginia is 22nd in the
                nation at 26.7 accidents and Delaware is 24th at 26.2. And right in out backyard, Washington D.C. stands
                at 7th worst in the nation with 37.4 accidents per 1,000 drivers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Well that at face value proves that Maryland drivers are in fact bad drivers, but there are questions to
                sift through still. First is are we top 10 in all incidents? Second, why are Marylanders this high in
                accidents per 1,000 drivers? Is it something to do with the bar being low to pass the MVA tests? And
                what can we do to as a state get better at driving?
            </p>

    <h2> So how can we change the "Maryland Driver" narrative? </h2>
    <p>
        Most articles I see when I ask these questions have to do with what the individual driver can do better,
        "defensive driving" and such. But I think improvement has to start in the tests. In personal experience, there
        wasn't enough emphasis on technique and actual experience on highways or on the road in programs that you have
        to take after getting provisional. So I think statewide driving programs need to get drivers more experience on
        high intensity situations like the highway, especially since that's where so much of Maryland transportation
        takes place.

            This is data taken from a <a
                href="https://deepcreektimes.com/marylanders-rank-among-americas-least-improved-drivers-5-year-study/">Deep
                Creek Times article</a> that measured nation wide driving improvement from 2018 to
            2022. Maryland stands at 41st in terms of improvement compared to the rest of America, and it's clear why we
            have the narrative of the "Maryland Driver" in our heads.

        As a Maryland driver, I offer now my perspective on a simple way the MVA programs can improve. First, when I
        studied
        under the Leap Driving Academy of Greenbelt, we didn't nearly have enough real life application to
        supplement
        all the quizzes we took. I suggest <b>increasing the time spent on freeways and highways </b> before class
        completion,
        so that newer drivers can get more experienced with what may become daily routes to their lives.

    <p>
        But to really get somewhere with this issue we have to fix our driving culture. In a <a
            href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/road-rage-incidents-increase-maryland/61767641"> WBAL article,</a>
        Baltimore
        county police detective Tyler Rivers noted how Maryland drivers so comfortably exude an angry and
        disrespectful
        driving culture.
    </p>

    <p>
        "On a daily basis, I've seen driving behavior of people switching
        lanes, unsafe speeding, not stopping at red lights," said Rivers. "Road rage incidents stem from aggressive
        driving behavior. I
        believe it has increased in the past two, three years."
    </p>

    <p>
        Before we change fundamental aspects of the MVA program, I think it could benefit us a lot in an individual
        level to drive like we aren't the 8th worst drivers in America. It comes down to an individual choice to not
        put
        yourself and other people in danger, little things like not taking your phone out, not road raging, and
        genuinely acknowledging the responsibility you have to those around you when you're out on the road.
