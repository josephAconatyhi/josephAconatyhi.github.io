            <h1> Early life </h1>
            <p>Wilson was born in Dallas, the middle child of three sons of photographer Laura Cunningham Wilson (b.
                1939)
                and Robert Andrew Wilson (1941–2017), an advertising executive and operator of a public television
                station.
                His brothers Andrew and Luke are also actors. Wilson's parents are of Irish descent. As a teenager,
                Wilson
                broke his nose twice: the first time in a high school fight, and the second time playing football with
                friends. “You know, probably my nose wouldn’t have been that great even if it hadn’t been broken,"
                Wilson
                told The Los Angeles Times.

            </p>

            <p> After getting expelled for cheating in geometry, he attended New Mexico Military Institute. He later
                attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, but
                did not graduate. While in college, he met and was roommates with director and frequent collaborator Wes
                Anderson.

            <h2> Career </h2>
            <h3> 1994–1999: Early films and breakthrough </h3>
            <p> Wilson made his film debut acting in the Wes Anderson short film <i> Bottle Rocket </i> (1994) which was
                later expanded into the feature-length film <i> Bottle Rocket </i> (1996) which Wilson co-wrote with
                Anderson. Wilson also acted opposite his brother Luke Wilson. David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter
                praised the film describing it as, "A marvelous debut film for its director, writer and lead actors,
                Bottle Rocket is propelled by a fresh approach to the caper genre".[9] That same year, he had a
                supporting role in the black comedy <i> The Cable Guy </i>(1996) starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ben
                Stiller, an early admirer of Bottle Rocket. Wilson played Leslie Mann's date in the film. In 1997, he
                had a role in the adventure thriller <i> Anaconda</i> and executive produced the James L. Brooks comedy
                <i>As Good as It Gets</i>.

            </p>
            <p> In 1998, Wilson had roles in the science fiction disaster film <i> Armageddon </i> and the independent
                drama film <i> Permanent Midnight </i>. He also reunited with Anderson co-writing the script for
                Anderson's next two directorial films, <i> Rushmore </i> and <i> The Royal Tenenbaums </i>, for which
                they garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. While Wilson did not act in <i> Rushmore
                </i>, he appears briefly in a photograph in the film.[10][11][12] After appearing in supporting roles in
                1999, he acted in horror film <i> The Haunting</i>, <i> The Minus Man</i>, in which his future
                girlfriend, singer Sheryl Crow, was a co-star.

            <h3> 2000-2006: Film Stardom </h3>
            <img src="2003.JPG" alt="Wilson in 2003">
            <p> Wilson starred in the 2000 comedy action film <i> Shanghai Noon </i> alongside Jackie Chan. The film
                grossed nearly $100 million worldwide. His fame continued to rise after starring alongside Ben Stiller
                and Will Ferrell in the 2001 film <i> Zoolander </i>. Gene Hackman reportedly took notice of Wilson's
                performance in <i> Shanghai Noon </i> and recommended the actor to co-star in the 2001 action film <i>
                    Behind Enemy Lines </i>. Also in 2001, Wilson and Anderson collaborated on their third film, <i> The
                    Royal Tenenbaums </i>, a financial and critical success. The film earned the writing team an Academy
                Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.[13]
            </p>
            <p> Wilson returned to the buddy-comedy genre in 2002 with the action comedy <i> I Spy </i>, co-starring
                Eddie Murphy. The big-screen remake of the same-named television series did not perform well at the box
                office. He made a cameo appearance in the Girl Skateboards video Yeah Right! in 2003. He then reunited
                with Chan to make <i> Shanghai Knights </i> (2003), and co-starred in the film remake of the 1970s
                television series <i> Starsky & Hutch </i> (2004). Due to his busy schedule as an actor and an ongoing
                sinus condition, Wilson was unavailable to collaborate on the script for Wes Anderson's fourth feature
                film, <i> The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou </i>. The 2004 film was ultimately co-written by filmmaker
                Noah Baumbach. However, Wilson did star in the film as Bill Murray's would-be son, <i> Ned Plimpton
                </i>; it was a role written specifically for him.[14] In 2004, he and his brother Luke played the Wright
                brothers in the 2004 film <i> Around the World in 80 Days </i>. Wilson is said to be attached to a
                sequel to <i> Shanghai Knights </i>, marking his third collaboration with Jackie Chan.[15]

            </p>
            <p> Wilson partnered with Vince Vaughn in the 2005 comedy film <i> Wedding Crashers </i>, which grossed over
                $200 million in the US alone. Also in 2005, Owen collaborated with his brothers in <i> The Wendell Baker
                    Story</i>, written by Luke and directed by Luke and Andrew.[16] In 2006, Wilson voiced Lightning
                McQueen in the Disney/Pixar film <i> Cars</i>, starred in <i>You, Me and Dupree with Kate Hudson</i>,
                and appeared with Stiller in <i>>Night at the Museum</i> as cowboy Jedediah.

                During this time, Wilson gained a reputation for frequently exclaiming "Wow!" in his roles, becoming
                something of a meme, as well as his trademark.[17]

                acclaim. The film became Allen's highest grossing thus far,[22] and was also well received by
                critics.[23] Roger Ebert wrote of Wilson's performance, "[He] is a key to the movie's appeal".[24] Peter
                Debruge of Variety also praised Wilson, writing "Wilson makes the role endearingly his own".[25] For his
                performance, Wilson earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture
                Musical or Comedy.

                <h2> Personal life </h2>
                <p> In August 2007, Wilson attempted suicide and was subsequently treated for depression at St. John's
                    Health Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. A few days after his hospitalization,
                    Wilson withdrew from his role in Tropic Thunder. The incident resulted in much unwanted publicity
                    for Wilson, and he became reluctant in doing interviews. In a 2021 interview with Esquire, Wilson
                    briefly opened up about his suicide attempt, describing how his brothers supported him during his
                    recovery.

                </p>
                <p> In January 2011, Wilson and his then-girlfriend Jade Duell had a son. Wilson and Duell ended their
                    relationship later that year. In January 2014, he had a son with Caroline Lindqvist. He had a third
                    child, a daughter, in October 2018 with ex-girlfriend Varunie Vongsvirates.
